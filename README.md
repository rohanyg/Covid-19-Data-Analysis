### Project Overview
The COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard uses Power BI to analyse trends, patterns and insights from COVID-19 data. This Dashboard helps to track covid cases, deaths, vaccination rate and fatality rate. My work involved data cleaning, transforming the data and creating visualizations to design the dashboard.This project helps in data-driven decision-making for resource allocation and strategic planning in times of health emergency.

### Business Task
To design a dashboard to track covid cases, deaths, vaccination rate and fatality rate in India and Asia and To analyze COVID-19 data to identify trends and patterns over period of time.

### Data Sources

COVID Data:

### Result/Findings
Key findings from the analysis:
- Higher recovery rates observed post vaccination drives, indicating vaccine effect.
- Regions with denser populations experienced more rapid virus spread.
  
### Limitations 

- There can be a delay in reporting COVID-19 cases and deaths, leading to incomplete and outdated data.
- Socio-economic factors such as access to healthcare, living conditions and economic stability can influence COVID-19 outcomes. Ignoring these factors can lead to incomplete insights into the pandemic's impact on different regions.
- Demographic factors such as age, gender and underlying health conditions can significantly influence COVID-19 outcomes. Failing to account for these factors can lead to skewed interpretations.
- Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to biased analysis and misinterpretation of trends.
